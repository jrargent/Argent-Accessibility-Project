# Module-1-Challenge: Adding Accessibility Features to an Existing Website

I was given a website and tasked with making sure it met accessibility standards.

In this project, I had to go through existing code, update it to meet accesibility standards, and clean up resulting unnecessary bloat in the CSS file.

The website was coded using HTML and styled with CSS.

This project was tasked to meet the following criteria:

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```


## Items that I fixed
- Added semantic HTML to meet acceptance criteria
- Broken link in the header for "Search Engine Optimization"
- Corrected heading attribute sequence in footer. Changed h2 to h4 
- Added alt text to all image tags to meet accessibility standards
- Condensed div classes and condensed CSS elements
- Removed unnecessary classes and elements in HTML and CSS files resulting from prior step
- Added a more descriptive title


## Things I learned in this challenge
- It is harder to go through someone else's code than my own
- Website accessibility is incredibly important
- Semantic HTML helps keep code easier to read
- Using Chrome Dev Tools is incredibly handy for testing changes
